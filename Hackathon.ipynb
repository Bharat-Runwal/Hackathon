I hope you find some peace soon. krmae26\n",
      "Do not feel bad AT ALL. My children are 6,5,4, and 3 and us too have been cooped up since early March. You’re right it does get old doing activities indoors and outdoors. There’s only so much to pass time. I don’t know how many things you have done so I will just share all the things we have to throw ideas out there. Kinetic sand (huge hit), painting, writing letters to people, photo shoots, ordered off Amazon trunks for dress up, photo shoots, painting, making flowers projects, making cards for patients at St Judes, riding bikes, YouTube videos educational, and the fun, rainy days we do the indoor activities. Sunny days, I put holes in the hose and made a sprinkler, they loved that. We wash the car and cars for sale (we have a dealership), they can wash yours. We remodeled the inside of our house, they helped with that as much as their ages would allow. We organized closets, threw out old toys, went through the whole house, we do treasure hunts in the house (I hide clues and eggs) we have made maps of where we found stuff. Pretty much anything right now is a game. We do movie nights where we make popcorn, and change into our favorite PJs. Anything and everything is a game. \n",
      "But I will be honest, I have had my breakdowns from sheer exhaustion. And so have my children missing their friends. This has been by far the hardest thing I have ever done non stop 24/7. Before this, they were in daycare 6 days a week because we have our own business. And like you, at first it was awesome to slow down from the hectic life and schedule we had at first, but I’ve almost went Britney and shaved my head a couple times. It gets to be too much and seems to have no end. There will be an end, maybe not soon, but there will. Normality will come. Hang in there, vent away, you can reach out to me personally on here and I will give you my #. You do need a break, and I’m proud of you for expressing it and asking for it. I completely get it. And sometimes just knowing that what you feel is 100% normal during this tough time and understood by fellow moms and talking to them is all you need. Hugs to you.
